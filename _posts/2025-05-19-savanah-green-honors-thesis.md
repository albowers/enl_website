We want to congratulate Savanah on the completion of her honors thesis. She collected and helped to analyze data from over 70 respondents to a survey asking questions about what stuttering feels like, how individuals define it, and what fluency feels like. The responses from the survey also led to other graduate student projects, including a master's thesis project developing a questionnaire from the responses. We look forward to everything Savanah will do as she works toward her master's degree in speech-language pathology at the University of Central Arkansas!
