Leslie is a first-year graduate student working on her master's in speech-language pathology at the University of Arkansas. Leslie has already received an award as a student clinician and she is now working on a master's thesis in the ENL. Leslie's project focuses on developing a questionnaire tool to assess interoceptive awareness in individuals who stutter. This tool aims to capture subjective experiences of stuttering and fluency, providing valuable insights into an awareness of stuttering. We look forward to what we can learn from it toward developing a valid instrument that can measure an interoceptive awareness of stuttering. Please contact Dr. Andrew Bowers (albowers@uark.edu) or Leslie (lesliewilliams@uark.edu) for a link to the questionnaire. She recently had a poster presentation accepted at the ASHA convention for this year and plans to attend the conference in November.
