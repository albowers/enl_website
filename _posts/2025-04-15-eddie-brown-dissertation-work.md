Eddie Brown is a doctoral candidate at the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center working with Dr. Tim Saltuklaroglu. He recently completed two published projects one of which contributes to our understanding of EEG correlates of stuttering. Eddie's work has already been recognized for its innovative approach and implications. He is now embarking on his dissertation research, which will further explore novel approaches to therapy for adults who stutter and track outcomes using new measures. The EEG dataset Eddie collected in his second project, for the first time, allows us to examine EEG oscillations in a naturalistic question and answer task that has yielded a number of novel and interesting insights about the importance of task demands. The data he collected is continuing to yield new insights into multiple processes mediating responses to those tasks and measures of stuttering.
